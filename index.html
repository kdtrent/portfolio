                <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>Hello my name is Kaleb Trent, and I am an undergraduate Mechanical Engineering Student at MIT. <br>

                    I enjoy working with my hands, and challengining myself to do better. <br>

                    One of the greatest pieces of advise that I have ever recieved was from an old mentor in Blacksmithing.
                    He said, "The best tool for the job is what you hvae on hand." This has helped me to take what I have with
                    me to find solutions to the problems I encounter during my everyday life. <br>

                    This is commit number 2 of 08/13/2025 at 21.19 p.m.</p>

                        <h3>Blacksmithing</h3>
                            <p>I use round rebar for most of my commissions or personal projects in the forge. seeing as most rebar is
                                an alloy of wrought and high-carbon it makes good for minimal things, and while yes there are grading
                                systems in place for rebar it isn't important for these descriptions.</p>

                            <h4>V-Bit Bolt-Jaw Tongs</h4>
                            <img src="v-bit_bolt-jaw_tongs.jpg" width="25%" height="auto">
                            <p>These tongs are made from .5'' round rebar. The open jaw design allows the user to grab odd-shaped
                                things. Along with the bolt-jaw I also included v-bit groves with 1 running perpendicular to the handle,
                                and the other running parallel to allow me to hold things in different orientations. These were the first
                                things I forged, and while yes there </p>

                            <h4>Leaf Pendants</h4>
                            <img src="leaf_pendants.jpg" width="25%" height="auto">
                            <p>These are all made from .25'' round rebar. First you have to taper away from you about a .25'' section at
                                one end of the stock. Then you can isolate the section on the shoulder of the anvil. Flaten out the
                                tapered sections to get the leaf shape. Then taper towards you about .5''+ of stock.
                                This will then be curled around the horn of the anvil to provide the rign for the pendant.</p>

                            <h4>Hooks</h4>
                                <p>These hooks designs all use the base forging premise of tapering, and rounding as the main
                                    manufacturing methods. For smaller hooks using about 3" of stock each I taper between .5" to 1" of material,
                                    When making a set I either use a piece of soap stone to make son my anvil where the stock needs to by cut,
                                    or I premake my billets.</p>

                                <h5>Wall Hooks</h5>
                                <img src="wall_hooks.jpg" width="25%" height="auto">
                                <p>Then we bend the tapered portion around the horn of the anvil.
                                    Next we take the other end of the stock and taper about an inch of the material from about .25" to
                                    .15" this allows up to then bend a hole for a nail into the rebar. </p>

                                <img src="leaf_wall_hooks.jpg" width="25%" height="auto">
                                <p>These are all made from .25'' round rebar. Once the taper is done.  </p>

                                <p>These are all made from .25'' round rebar.</p>

                                <h5>Square "S" Hooks</h5>
                                <img src="square_s_hooks.jpg" width="25%" height="auto">
                                <p>The left hook is made from .25'' round rebar which I forged square. The right hook is make
                                    from .25'' square rot-iron.</p>
